    <tr>
        <td><strong>Inconsistency</strong>:
            Different teams have different opinions on technology practices.
        </td>
        <td>When teams have different practices, they are prone to achieve
            different outcomes that require multiple resolutions
            before a full production release.
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><strong>Platform diversity</strong>:
            Provisioning workflows can vary depending on the target Cloud platforms,
            VMware or Kubernetes environments.

        </td>
        <td>Separate workflow processes across multiple target environments introduce
            significant overhead for development, release and maintenance.
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><strong>Image sprawl</strong>:
            Image diversity across multiple platforms leads to an extensive collection of assets.
        </td>
        <td>Teams that do not track their image assets centrally contribute to inconsistency,
            higher costs and security exposures.
        </td>
