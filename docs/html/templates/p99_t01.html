    <tr>
        <td><strong>Establish standardization</strong>:
            Use standardized deployment templates to resolve the practices disparities.
        </td>
        <td> Teams are neither ahead nor behind in technology choices. And, an intentional
            synchronization saves time with testing cycles and minimizes edge cases that
            may undermine the overall health of the final deliverable.
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><strong>Process alignment</strong>:
            Establish the same process to develop, secure, validate and implement machine
            images across all Cloud platforms, VMware and Kubernetes environments.
        </td>
        <td> Teams meet the same standards for infrastructure creation in development, release
            and maintenance stages. Teams follow guidelines for human interaction, data format,
            network protocols, ports and secure logical paths for communication.
        </td>

    <tr>
        <td><strong>Strong Governance</strong>:
            With corporate guidance, teams can automate the promotion of infrastructure
            to support emerging standards.
        </td>
        <td> Teams can plan for emerging improvements to their machine images and promote
            them using modern DevOps automation patterns from development to pre-production
            to production stages.
